# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Here are some guidelines to make the contribution process as smooth and efficient as possible.

## General Rules

1. **Be polite and respectful.** We are all working together to make this project better.
2. **Follow the code structure and style.** Familiarize yourself with the existing code and adhere to the same stylistic principles.
3. **Write clear and informative comments.** This will help others understand your changes.

## Code Requirements

1. **Use Git for version control.** Before making changes, create a new branch for your work.
2. **Describe changes in commits.** Each commit should have a clear and informative description.
3. **Follow code formatting.** Use the formatting settings already applied in the project.
4. **Test your code.** Ensure your code compiles and runs without errors before creating a Pull Request.

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the project.** This will create a copy of the project in your GitHub account.
2. **Create a new branch.** Use the command `git checkout -b my-feature` to create a new branch.
3. **Make changes.** Make the necessary changes to the code.
4. **Commit changes.** Use the command `git commit -m "Description of changes"` to save your changes.
5. **Push changes.** Use the command `git push origin my-feature` to push your changes to GitHub.
6. **Create a Pull Request.** **Note: Pull Requests should only be made to the `dev` branch.** Merging to `main` should only be done after review and readiness for release, as it triggers a workflow to publish a new version of the mod to Modrinth. This requires updating the mod version and making other necessary changes.

## Reporting Issues

1. **Create an Issue.** If you find a bug, please create an Issue on GitHub with a detailed description.
2. **Describe the problem.** Provide steps to reproduce the bug and the expected behavior.

## Feature Requests

1. **Create an Issue.** If you have an idea for a new feature, please create an Issue with a description of your idea.
2. **Discussion.** Before starting work on a new feature, wait for feedback from other project members.

Thank you for helping to improve our project!
