Hi! Version 0.2.5.4

- Fixed scaling for macro's screens, now you can use it with any ui scale
- Fixed but with key handler in macro edit screen (before you can't press backspace, now you can)
- Cleanups "under the hood" deleted useless "dead" code
- Removed useless argument "test" from /redstone-helper
- Removed useless argument "cleanup" from /redstone-helper
- Now if redstone helper created a config file the first time, it didn't cause errors in logs
